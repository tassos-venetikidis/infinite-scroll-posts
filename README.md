# Infinite Scroll Posts

Simple UI that implements infinite scroll that reaches out to the JSON Placeholder API and gets placeholder posts in batches of five. When scrolling at the bottom of the page, it reaches out to the API yet again to get the next five posts. Furthermore, it allows for the filtering of displayed posts according to user input on the corresponding input field.

App implementation based on:

- Fetch requests to the JSON Placeholder API
- Display of a loading animation, crafted in CSS, while waiting for the request-response cycle
- Filtering of displayed posts, according to user-specified input
